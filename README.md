# BeautifulSoup-Email-Scraper
Scrapes emails from a given website. It may later become pretty with a TkInter UI.

Before you judge my terrible four repeating code blocks, understand I haven't touched
regex in forever, and while
[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+(@|\[at\]|\[@\])[A-Za-z0-9.-]+(\.|\[dot\]|\[.\])[A-Za-z]{2,4}
was supposed to work, I think I misused a regex operator and instead of regex returning
the whole string it return bits and pieces. This will be an ongoing project along with
a few other tools. I need to refactor this code. It's very disorganized.
